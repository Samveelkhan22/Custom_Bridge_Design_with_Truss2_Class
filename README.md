# Custom_Bridge_Design_with_Truss2_Class
This repository contains a Python script for designing custom bridges using the Truss2 class. The Truss2 class is an extension of the sympy.physics.continuum_mechanics.truss.Truss class, tailored for efficient bridge design.

# Features
Interactive bridge design based on user input.
Truss nodes and beams generation.
Road sections and supports application.
Visualization of internal forces and bridge configuration.
How to Use
Run the interactive_bridge_design() function to initiate the interactive bridge design.
Enter the required parameters such as bridge length, number of segments, maximum truss height, exit height, minimum clearance, and moving mass when prompted.
The designed bridge is saved in a pickle file (bridge_design.pickle) for further analysis.

# Dependencies
Python 3.x
